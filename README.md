> To reduce the potential radiation risk, low-dose CT has attracted much attention. However, simply lowering the radiation dose will lead to significant deterioration of the image quality. In this paper, we propose a noise reduction method for low-dose CT via deep neural network without accessing original projection data. A deep convolutional neural network is trained to transform low-dose CT images towards normal-dose CT images, patch by patch. Visual and quantitative evaluation demonstrates a competing performance of the proposed method.

- [ ] [Multimodal Brain MRI Tumor Segmentation via Convolutional Neural Networks]()

> Glioma are the most common family of brain tumors, with a subset of glioma known as glioblastoma forming the most common and some of the highest-mortality and economically costly forms of brain cancer. Patients are diagnosed based on manual segmentation and analysis of multimodal MRI scans, but due to the labor-intensive nature of the manual segmentation process and mistakes or disagreement between manual segmentations, there exists a need for a fast and robust automated segmentation algorithm. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been shown to be extremely effective for a variety of visual recognition and semantic segmentation tasks. Here, we present three
> novel CNN-based architectures for glioma segmentation for images from the MICCAI BraTS Challenge dataset. We also explore transfer learning between the BraTS dataset and other neuroimaging datasets by applying models pretrained on the BraTS dataset to segmenting images from the Rembrandt dataset. Our results show that patch-wise approaches trained on a balanced training set of tumor and non-tumor patches delivers strong segmentation results with mean dice score of 0.86. The results from transfer learning show that applying models pre-trained on the BraTS dataset to other neuroimaging datasets is promising but requires further work.
